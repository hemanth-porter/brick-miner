Connected with vendor : connected with vendor and shared him feedback and asked him what issues happened in shifting because customer informed me only high quotation issue . then he said customer mentioned only 4 boxes but while packing time increased extra 15 gunny bags and gas stove and loose items so for this he informed in cc , but customer denied to pay amount and said cancel the order . but cc agent convinced the customer so he did this shifting and he said customer informed him to remove items from vehicle don't want to shift , but after lots of convince customer agreed i said ok and informed him customer told me partner also had price issue so i asked you so he said no there is totally extra material issues i said ok i will update it and he agreed.
Connected with customer: Feedback call - customer not answering the call. customer not answering the call. connected with customer and asked her about feedback so she said price is to high and she will never use again so i asked her issues , then she said for 30km distance you charge low amount and for 2 km you charge high amount , so i informed her we are providing any manually amount because it is totally system auto generated amount then she said ok but then to its high and i asked her any issues in shifting or with crew members so she said they also have issue with price . then i informed her i will coordinate with partner also and i will share them feedback and take feedback so we can take care of this and she agreed.

Connected with vendor : connected with vendor and shared him feedback and asked him have you informed customer 70 or 80 rs per box charges so he said no he not informed but may be his labor informed i said ok . but he said he also knows 50rs per box has to inform customer i said ok customer informed me she given bad ratings to company because of date and time quote amount got increased and for boxes i just wants to confirm with you so he said ok .
Connected with customer:Feedback call - connected with customer and asked her about feedback so she informed agent to change the date and time but the quotation amount got increased so she didnt like it because while booking time she asked the agent can she change date and time anytime so agent informed her yes . then she did the changes but amount got changed . after shifting she informed partner to leave the cartoon boxes but he asked her to pay 70 or 80 rs per box charges . now she asked me how much per box charges so i informed her 50rs per box charges and we mentioned in list of material pdf so she said she not saw that i said ok . then she said crew members did shifting smoothly and quickly no issues for them  and she said she given bad ratings to company not to partner i said ok and apologize her and informed her will take care of this and she agreed.

Connected with vendor : partner number is out of network area.connected with vendor and shared him feedback so he asked me which supervisor assigned in this so i informed him then he asked me to take con call with him i said ok so i took con call with supervisor and shared him feedback so he said customer had lots of extra material . but customer informed him while booking time he clearly informed all items but agent not added and then quotation amount got revised to 16850 but customer paid him only 12000 rs because agent shared 2 to 3 different quotation amount to customer and he not received any call from resolution team and he waited 4 hrs at customer location for payment and at last he collected only 12k amount from customer because customer was to irate not received any resolution from team and he faced loss of 2800 rs in this order and not received also so i apologize him and informed him please allow some time i will check with team and update you so he agreed. because of lms agent error vendor faced loss in this order so i listened call recording also . connected with supervisor and informed him i already shared you feedback and issue happened in shifting for extra material and so as per city team update we are adding 1200 rs goodwill from our end he said ok add it but now already commission deducted of 800 rs so do it accordingly and update it so i informed him for commission related please talk with city team so they will clearly help you . then he said ok you add 1200 rs and he will check with city team i said ok .
Connected with customer: Feedback call - customer not answering the call.connected with customer and asked him about feedback so he said  while booking time he clearly informed agent to add material and individually he informed agent all material but agent not added so on the day of shifting he faced lots of issue because of booking agent . then he said he received revised quotation 3 times like 16k quote then 15k quote , then 13k quote . but he paid only 12k to partner because that was not his mistake because he clearly informed agent to add it but not added . then he said he not received call from resolution and he said instead of porter he will go with local they will do his shifting in 8k . so i apologize him and informed him will take care of this so it will not repeat again next time to any other customer . but he said while shifting time your crew members gone for lunch 1 hr and 30 mins because of that he faced delay in his shifting . so again i apologize him and informed him will share strong feedback to partner and i will educate and guide them so it will not repeat and he agreed.

#N/A,2/12/2023 9:49:39,9354331028,6,,Shifting Experience,"Shifting Experience. The professional Mr. Pandit who was assigned for moving some of my items from Vasant kunj (kishangarh) to Noida on 11/02/2023.

My experience with the Porter professional was not very unsatisfactory because of the following reasons:
1) the professional reported 1:30 hrs late
2) No packaging items were brought. 
3) His way of communication with customer wasn't polite AT ALL. 
4) He doesn't know how to Bubble wrap just a simple thing. 
My items includes 2 bags, inverter & with battery and window AC and bed side runner carpet. 
I booked for 5 cartoon box. He didn't bring any. 
So the other items were taken in loose not packed inside the box. 
He refuse to packed the items in my room stating that the items will be difficult to carry it downstairs. Whereas I strongly mentioned to him that - I DO NOT WANT MY ITEMS TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM UNPACKED. He denied. 
So I let him go with his wishes. 

Despite of my request to call and notify me once the loading is completed.  He didn't care to update me. He reaches the destination very late.

I tried calling him continuously  to asked if he has loaded all the items carefully. He didn't attend to my calls. 
So I had to chanel my calls toward the Porter customer care just to speak with him. 

Overall experience with the professional Pandit, I would not recommend anyone now I am not sure if I should use the service again for my house shifting or should go for other company. 

Thanking you for providing this platform to share the our issues.

Connected with vendor : connected with partner and shared him feedback and informed him customer conversation so he said customer mentioned 0 - 3 feet almirah but customer had 9 feet almirah and he not mentioned mattress and computer table then to adjusted in vehicle and he informed in cc also but customer denied to pay the amount and informed to cancel the order and slot time was at 4 pm but because of all this issue again changed the slot at 5 pm and then he completed the shifting and said no issue from his side i said ok . i just shared you feedback because it will affect on services and ratings and he agreed.
Connected with customer:customer number is out of network area .connected with customer and asked him about feedback so he said your crew members dumped the material and for his folding cot not did dismantle and reassemble also and his nuts bolt and screws also missed so i apologize him and asked him why you not raised concern to us so he said he mentioned in feedback . then i informed him as per T and C you have to raise concern within 24 to 48 hrs via call or mail so he said he dont have that much time to read all things . but he asked can you send someone to do that i said now its not possible but i will share strong feedback to partner and i will educate and guide them so it will not repeat and he said ok.

Very careless, annoying and unprofessional handling done by your staff or your third party. 

They are not at all trained people and they don’t use their common sense while handling the almari, washing machine, fridge and grinder. 

They just dragged, lifted with less safety, hitting the door and wall edges inspite of repeated advice. 

No manager was available and they did not do bubble rap protection for the fridge or washing machine.

Connected with vendor : partner number is busy. connected with partner and shared him feedback , so he asked me reason for bad feedback so i informed him customer said he paid extra 500 rs and he not enjoyed in shifting . then he said all crew members facing issue while shifting time most of times they get injured by furniture's and customer said he not enjoyed , then he said booking team not taking orders properly and because of them they are facing issue and in this order he sent 4 people for shifting because of heavy material so i apologize him and informed him so i told him customer informed me like this so i just informing you and said please refund that extra 500 rs to customer so he said he will confirm from supervisor and he will refund it , but supervisor said customer paid him via cash and he not received any extra 500 rs i said ok , partner said customer called supervisor after 2 days later and informed him he paid extra and then he said customer has to check on the same day , i said yes and informed him  customer told me today only so i asked him can i take con call with customer he said take , so partner and customer both coordinated related to amount and partner agreed to refund the amount of 500 rs because customer said he not asked any refund but he knows that he paid extra to supervisor thats it , so partner confirmed number from him so he can refund it and both agreed issue resolved
Connected with customer:Feedback call -connected with customer asked him about feedback so he said he had to pay 2925 but by mistakenly he paid 3500 rs and he called partner also and informed him to . but he not received amount so i asked him any issue in shifting . so he said he not enjoyed shifting because crew members not able to do shifting so he arranged extra labors from his side and did shifting i said ok , so i asked him can i take con call with partner so i will inform him to refund your amount so he said no please , then i informed him i will coordinate with partner separately and i will update you so he said after 12 pm update him i said ok.

1. Tv installation was not done for which I have paid
2. No proper packaging of electronic goods.
3. Missing water filter in RO which would cost me 3.5k for a new purchase now.
4. Missing sofa pillow 
5. Damage of goods like wodden cot 
6. Splliage of oil , pulses and cereals which took more than two hours of cleanup.
7. Nasty unpacking of stuff due to their negligence 
8. More than all of these mentally I suffered a lot when they couldn't what was promised.

I would rate the service pathetic and would like to raise a concern with the authorities at the earliest.
