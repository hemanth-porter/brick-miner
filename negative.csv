1,"I was happy with the service and tipped the packers for their work. But then I got to knowni have two big cartons (3.5x2 size self packed in advance) missing since the unloading time which I realised next day as it was very late by the time unloading and unpacking was completed. My calls next day were not returned by the packers and failed/unreplied emails to the lady who was otherwise available during shifting. It is very sad that post shifting, customer care is not available even after emails. This is not expected and it's cheating and thieving a customer who puts trust in Porter. Who's responsible for my loss here? No, I am not recommending Porter to anyone. ",Negative

37,Order booking process was good. However the vendor the order was given to did not come and pre-inspect the goods to be moved and came very ill-equipped with manpower packing material and vehicles.  Certain items have been left in my old residence and I shall have to pay again to have them shifted. Items like cupboards chairs and mirror have been left. Your shifting crew completed loading at 10 pm and completed unloaded the cargo at my residence at 4am without fully unpacking and assembling all items. You should have your supervisor vendor come and inspect the items for shifting before the rate is finalised. I was also forced to pay additional charges after the packing was completed.,Negative
